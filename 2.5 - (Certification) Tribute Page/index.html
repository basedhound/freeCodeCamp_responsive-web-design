          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Dreams. Each man longs to pursue his dream. Each man is tortured by this dream, but the dream gives
              meaning to his
              life. Even if the dream ruins his life, man cannot allow himself to leave it behind. In this world, is man
              ever able to
              possess anything more solid, than a dream?”
