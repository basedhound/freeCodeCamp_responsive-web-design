      <header><h1>Why Vite</h1></header>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and
        leaner
        development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

      <ul>
        <li>
          A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot
          Module
          Replacement (HMR).
        </li>
        <li>
          A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets
          for
          production.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box. Read about what's possible in the Features
      Guide.
      Support for frameworks or integration with other tools is possible through Plugins. The Config Section explains
      how to
      adapt Vite to your project if needed.

      Vite is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

      You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the Why Vite section.</p>

      <h2>Browser Support</h2>
      <p>During development, Vite sets esnext as the transform target, because we assume a modern browser is used and it
        supports
        all of the latest JavaScript and CSS features. This prevents syntax lowering, letting Vite serve modules as
        close as
        possible to the original source code.

        For the production build, by default Vite targets browsers that support native ES Modules, native ESM dynamic
        import,
        and import.meta. Legacy browsers can be supported via the official @vitejs/plugin-legacy. See the Building for
        Production section for more details.</p>

      <h2>Trying Vite Online</h2>
      <p>You can try Vite online on StackBlitz. It runs the Vite-based build setup directly in the browser, so it is
        almost
        identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine. You can navigate to
        vite.new/{template} to select which framework to use.
      </p>

      <h3>The supported template presets are:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Vue</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Preact</li>
        <li>Lit</li>
        <li>Svelte</li>
        <li>Solid</li>
        <li>Gwik</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Scaffolding Your First Vite Project</h2>

      <code>$ npm create vite@latest</code>

      <p>Then follow the prompts!
        You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line
        options. For
        example, to scaffold a Vite + Vue project, run:
      </p>

      <code># npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed: <br>
        npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue <br><br>
        
        # yarn<br>
        yarn create vite my-vue-app --template vue<br><br>
        
        # pnpm<br>
        pnpm create vite my-vue-app --template vue<br><br>
        
        # bun<br>
        bunx create-vite my-vue-app --template vue</code>

      <h2>Community Templates</h2>
      <p>create-vite is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out
        Awesome Vite
        for community maintained templates that include other tools or target different frameworks.

        For a template at https://github.com/user/project, you can try it out online using
        https://github.stackblitz.com/user/project (adding .stackblitz after github to the URL of the project).

        You can also use a tool like degit to scaffold your project with one of the templates. Assuming the project is
        on GitHub
        and uses main as the default branch, you can create a local copy using:</p>

      <code>npx degit user/project#main my-project <br>
      cd my-project<br><br>
      
      npm install<br>
      npm run dev</code>

      <h2>Command Line Interface</h2>
      <p>In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the vite binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with
        npx vite.
        Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:</p>

      <code>{<br>
"scripts": {<br>
"dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`<br>
"build": "vite build", // build for production<br>
"preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build<br>
}<br>
}</code>

      <p>You can specify additional CLI options like --port or --open. For a full list of CLI options, run npx vite
        --help in
        your project.</p>

      <h2>Using Unreleased Commits</h2>
      <p>If you can't wait for a new release to test the latest features, you will need to clone the vite repo to your
        local
        machine and then build and link it yourself (pnpm is required):</p>

      <code>git clone https://github.com/vitejs/vite.git <br>
cd vite<br>
pnpm install<br>
cd packages/vite<br>
pnpm run build<br>
pnpm link --global # use your preferred package manager for this step</code>

      <p>Then go to your Vite based project and run pnpm link --global vite (or the package manager that you used to
        link vite
        globally). Now restart the development server to ride on the bleeding edge!</p>

        npx vite.
        Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:</p>

      <code>{<br>
    "scripts": {<br>
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`<br>
    "build": "vite build", // build for production<br>
    "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build<br>
    }<br>
    }</code>

      <p>You can specify additional CLI options like --port or --open. For a full list of CLI options, run npx vite
        --help in
        your project.</p>

      <h2>Using Unreleased Commits</h2>
      <p>If you can't wait for a new release to test the latest features, you will need to clone the vite repo to your
        local
        machine and then build and link it yourself (pnpm is required):</p>

      <code>git clone https://github.com/vitejs/vite.git <br>
    cd vite<br>
    pnpm install<br>
    cd packages/vite<br>
    pnpm run build<br>
    pnpm link --global # use your preferred package manager for this step</code>

      <p>Then go to your Vite based project and run pnpm link --global vite (or the package manager that you used to
        link vite
        globally). Now restart the development server to ride on the bleeding edge!</p>

      <header>Using Plugins</header>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and
        leaner
        development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

      <ul>
        <li>
          A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot
          Module
          Replacement (HMR).
        </li>
        <li>
          A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets
          for
          production.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box. Read about what's possible in the Features
      Guide.
      Support for frameworks or integration with other tools is possible through Plugins. The Config Section explains
      how to
      adapt Vite to your project if needed.

      Vite is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

      You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the Why Vite section.</p>

      <h2>Browser Support</h2>
      <p>During development, Vite sets esnext as the transform target, because we assume a modern browser is used and it
        supports
        all of the latest JavaScript and CSS features. This prevents syntax lowering, letting Vite serve modules as
        close as
        possible to the original source code.

        For the production build, by default Vite targets browsers that support native ES Modules, native ESM dynamic
        import,
        and import.meta. Legacy browsers can be supported via the official @vitejs/plugin-legacy. See the Building for
        Production section for more details.</p>

      <h2>Trying Vite Online</h2>
      <p>You can try Vite online on StackBlitz. It runs the Vite-based build setup directly in the browser, so it is
        almost
        identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine. You can navigate to
        vite.new/{template} to select which framework to use.
      </p>

      <h3>The supported template presets are:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Vue</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Preact</li>
        <li>Lit</li>
        <li>Svelte</li>
        <li>Solid</li>
        <li>Gwik</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Scaffolding Your First Vite Project</h2>

      <code>$ npm create vite@latest</code>

      <p>Then follow the prompts!
        You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line
        options. For
        example, to scaffold a Vite + Vue project, run:
      </p>

      <code># npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed: <br>
          npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue <br><br>
          
          # yarn<br>
          yarn create vite my-vue-app --template vue<br><br>
          
          # pnpm<br>
          pnpm create vite my-vue-app --template vue<br><br>
          
          # bun<br>
          bunx create-vite my-vue-app --template vue</code>

      <h2>Community Templates</h2>
      <p>create-vite is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out
        Awesome Vite
        for community maintained templates that include other tools or target different frameworks.

        For a template at https://github.com/user/project, you can try it out online using
        https://github.stackblitz.com/user/project (adding .stackblitz after github to the URL of the project).

        You can also use a tool like degit to scaffold your project with one of the templates. Assuming the project is
        on GitHub
        and uses main as the default branch, you can create a local copy using:</p>

      <code>npx degit user/project#main my-project <br>
        cd my-project<br><br>
        
        npm install<br>
        npm run dev</code>

      <h2>Command Line Interface</h2>
      <p>In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the vite binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with
        npx vite.
        Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:</p>

      <code>{<br>
  "scripts": {<br>
  "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`<br>
  "build": "vite build", // build for production<br>
  "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build<br>
  }<br>
  }</code>

      <p>You can specify additional CLI options like --port or --open. For a full list of CLI options, run npx vite
        --help in
        your project.</p>

      <h2>Using Unreleased Commits</h2>
      <p>If you can't wait for a new release to test the latest features, you will need to clone the vite repo to your
        local
        machine and then build and link it yourself (pnpm is required):</p>

  cd vite<br>
  pnpm install<br>
  cd packages/vite<br>
  pnpm run build<br>
  pnpm link --global # use your preferred package manager for this step</code>

      <p>Then go to your Vite based project and run pnpm link --global vite (or the package manager that you used to
        link vite
        globally). Now restart the development server to ride on the bleeding edge!</p>
